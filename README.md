<h2> Extracting Cancer Treatments from clinical notes written in Spanish</h2>
This repository contains a BILSTM_CRF based neural model to extract cancer treatments from clinical notes written in Spanish. The model is based on a Bidirectional Long Short Memory (BiLSTM) Neural Net with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer.

This  approach  obtains  90%  in  F1  score  toperform Named Entity Recognition (NER) using an annotated corpus from clinical notes of lung cancer patients.
